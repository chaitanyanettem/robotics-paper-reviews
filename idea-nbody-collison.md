##Problems in n-body collision avoidance w.r.t drastic changes in environment (like water-to-air or air-to-water)

Berg et.al's paper regarding reciprocal n-body collision avoidance goes into details of a method for guaranteed local collision-free movement. That solution is however tailored for land based flat terrain environments (office environments). There is an opportunity here to generalize that method to cover cases where the terrain is not so flat and where the medium changes between water and land. Some of the robots maybe under water and some maybe in flight over it.
